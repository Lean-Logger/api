# Lean Logger

The 0% fat, open source lifestyle tracker!

## What is Lean Logger?

Lean Logger is a mobile application for people who would like to track their workouts and
food consumption.

## Is Lean Logger for me?

It depends. Here's why:

We're aware there's a plethora of other apps that track your food and workouts; we've
used A LOT of them. 

We find that many of them are bloated with unnecessary features that distract you from your 
true goals and end up being too complicated to use that it becomes a chore.

### Here's what we DON'T do:

* We don't offer you complicated sugar, salt & macro-nutrient tracking by
scanning the barcodes of your cucumbers and pickles. 
* We don't offer you a workout plan that will get you a 6-minute 6-pack

### So, what do we offer?

What we offer is simple - an easy way to log your workouts and your food so you can
your own records and hold your self accountable.

Had Grandmas Spaghetti Bolognese last night? Just add it! Nobody else will ever see it,
it's your own little library of food. Did you do 20 reps of the "scary machine by the
air conditioning unit"? Hey, if that makes sense to you, it's not harming anyone else, add it!
